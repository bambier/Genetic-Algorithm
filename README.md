# Genetic Algorithm for Optimizing a Systems

This algorithm was written acording to [*Modelling and Optimization of Biotechnological Processes*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-32493-5) **book**.

In this algorithm both `kinetic_expressions` and `multi_feed_expressions` function were
extracted from the book directly. `fitness` function also design as described in book. (*not direcly*)

Other functions including:

* `roulette_wheel_selection`
* `crossover`
* `mutation`
* `evolution`
* `main`

all were writen from scratch based on our need.
